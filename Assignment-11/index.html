        <p> 
            The game I am bringing up is the latest one in the series. <span id="LotR">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria. Hover over me.</span> <br />
            This game is a mix of minecraft and Deep Rock Galatic. It is a 4 player co-op game where you mine for resources, fight monsters, and build a base, or many many many bases. <br />
            The game has some bugs but is full of potential and is an absolute gem. Though one point of contention is <span id="mithrilarmor">mithril armor</span>. <br />
            PS DONT HOVER OVER MITHRIL ARMOR ABOVE IF YOU DONT WANT SPOILERS. <br />
