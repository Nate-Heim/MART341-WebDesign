        <h1>Assignment 5</h1>

        I get tired of reading poems that always rhyme so I put one here that doesn't. I know we didn't have to do this on Khan Academy, but I just decided to link it here to show 
        what I did.
        Also here's a list of some non rhyming types of poems.
        <l>Haiku (Japanese poetry type</l>
        <l>Concrete Poetry</l>
        <l>Acrostic</l>
        <l>Terza Rime (invented by Dante)</l>
        <h2>How to Not Rhyme </h2> 
    <p>Beneath the cerulean sky, I find my solace,<br>
    Amidst the rustling leaves and whispered breeze,<br>
    In the quiet moments, the world's noise recedes,<br>
    And I discover a profound sense of grace.</p>

<p>Nature's canvas, a tapestry of life's embrace,<br>
In every tree, a history of countless trees,<br>
A symbiotic dance of Earth and all that breathes,<br>
In this stillness, I glimpse eternity's face.</p>

<p>No need for rhymes or structured verse to share,<br>
For in the unspoken, there's a beauty rare,<br>
A world of thought and feeling, unconfined.</p>

<p>In the silent spaces, our hearts align,<br>
Where words fall short, the soul begins to care,<br>
In the silent spaces, our hearts intertwine.</p>+

We learned this week how to source our images properly and to use alt as well as resizing the image. Below is an example of how to do this.

Another thing we learned how to do this week was use the attribute for how to open a new webpage link.

<h1>The Doors of Stone</h1>
<h2>By Patrick Rothfuss</h2>
<p>
    The Book Doors of Stone is unknown, why because the author hasn't released it despite multiple promises to have it done for years.<br>
    It is the third book in the Kingkiller Chronicles, a series that has been in the works for years. The first book was released in 2007 and the second in 2011.<br>
    The author has been working on the third book for years and has been promising to release it for years. He has even gone so far as to say that he has finished it and is just editing it.<br>
    When the author has promised to read us a chapter of the book ,if enough donations were done, at a convention,<br> 
    he instead read us a chapter from a different book he was working on.<br>
</p>

<p>
    So, while I would love to regale you with the tales of how this masterful story is woven, alas I cannot.<br>
    For it is unknown, just like the author's ability to finish the book.<br>
    PS. I am not bitter at all about this, I just want to read the book. Okay maybe I'm a little bit bitter.<br>
